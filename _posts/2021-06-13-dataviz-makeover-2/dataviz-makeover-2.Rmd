# 1.	Introduction

## 1.1 Data Source
The data visualisations, including the original one and the redesigned one, were created by using data provided by Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS). The data are available under the sub-section of [Merchandise Trade by Region/Market](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data) and are compiled by the Enterprise Singapore.

## 1.2 The Original Visualisation
The original data visualisation that will be assessed was shown in the following figure. This visualization shows the merchandise trade, including export and import, between Singapore and top six trading countries during the period from January 2011 to December 2020.

# 2.	Critiques and Suggestions
## 2.1 Clarity
S/N | Critiques | Comments 
----|-----------|----------
1   |**There is not a title**: The lack of a title prevents the readers from quickly understanding the purpose of the visualisation. There are two notes for describing the information of this graph, but the long description is not so direct as a concise title.|Add a concise title, like "Singapore's Merchandise Trade Value with Ten Trading Partners, 2011-2020".
2   |**The lack of unit for x-axis and y-axis**: There are a series of numbers in x-axis and y-axis to show the values of exports and imports respectively, but there is not a label to show the unit of x-axis and y-axis.|Add the unit label of SGD in billion, "S$(Billion)" for x-axis and y-axis. 
3   |**The positions of titles for x-axis and y-axis are misleading**: Although the colors and icons can help readers to distinguish which axis is for import value and which axis is for export value, the unreasonable positions (at the beginning of each axis) of "Exports" and "Imports" for x-axis and y-axis are still very confusing.|Put the titles in the middle position of each axis.
4   |**There is not information about the study period**: We can't know the study period of this visualisation.|Add the period of "2011-2020" in the main title or add a note to show the period, "between January 2011-December 2020".
5   |**It is difficult to distinguish the import value and export value for each region**: Because there are a large amount of overlap parts among some bubbles or some centre points were covered by the labels of total trade value, we can't see all the centre points in the graph clearly. The hidden centre points prevent readers from knowing the import value and export value.|Make the size of each bubble smaller to show all the cretre points and move the positions of some labels.
6   |**The icons of "TOP NET EXPORTER" and "TOP NET IMPORTER" are confusing**: When readers firstly see the icons of  "TOP NET EXPORTER" and "TOP NET IMPORTER" in the graph, it is difficult for readers to know the meanings of the icons until they see the legends below. It is an indirect description.|Change the icons in the graph to texts of "TOP NET EXPORTER" and "TOP NET IMPORTER" and then remove the legend below.

## 2.2 Aesthetics
S/N | Critiques | Comments 
----|-----------|----------
1   |**The unreasonable layouts of the graph, the legend and notes**: The readers will be more easy to see the legend if the legend is closed to the graph part. However, positions of legends, "TOP NET EXPORTER" and "TOP NET IMPORTER", are below the note in this graph, the position is abnormal.At the same time, the abnormal layout causes the whole visualisation chaotic.| Put the legend on the left of the graph or above the note part.
2   |**Too large size of the bubbles**: Because there are some overlap part of bubbles due to the too large size, we can not see all the bubbles completely. Too large bubbles do not only cause difficulties in transferring information of the graph, but also cause the mussy layout.|Make the size of bubbles smaller.
3   |**Too many different fonts are used in this graph**: There are three different fonts are used in the part of graph, note and information description respectively. The inconsistent fonts will cause the all visualisation no so beautiful and professional.|Use the same font in the part of note and information description.
4   |**The background color of information description part is too dark**: The blue background color is more dark than other parts of this visualisation, so when readers see this visualisation, their attention will be caught by this part. The most important part, graph part, may not be focused on during readers' first reading.|Remove the background color of the information description part and change the font color to black as the font in note part.

# 3.	Proposed Visualisation
## 3.1 Sketch

![](images/2.jpg)
*Figure 2*

## 3.2 Advantages of Proposed Design
1) **Clear and interactive title**: The main title "Merchandise Trade Change and Comparison of Trading Partners, 2011-2020" shows the purpose of the visulisation and subtitles provide interactive parts of "(Period)" which will change as the reader's choice.
2) **Suitable size of the bubbles**: Adjust the size of bubbles in order to decrease the overlap area and show the bubble of each trading partner clearly.
3) **Simple and clear layout**: Delete the unnecessary part of the visualisation,like the information part at the bottom of the visualisation and adjust the layout of the visualisation.
4) **The use of interactive techniques**: Add interactive techniques to give the reader more freedom to read the images. For example, the readers can change the year and trading partners they want to know by using the function of filter.

# 4.	Data Visualisation Steps

## 4.1 Data Preparation
1) Download the dataset from the website of Department of Statistics, Singapore(DOS), and then open the file by Excel.Delete the unnecessary sheet of "Content" and then rename the sheets of "T1" and "T2" as "Import" and "Export".

![](images/3.png)
*Figure 3*

2) Select the useless rows from 1 to 5 and from 100 to 112 in sheets of both "Import" and "Export", and then delete these selected rows.

![](images/4.png)
*Figure 4*

3) Select the columns that are not in the study period, and then delete them in sheets of both "Import" and "Export".

![](images/5.png)
*Figure 5*

4) We will not use the data of continents and "Total Merchandise Imports", so the rows from 2 to 8 were seleced and deleted.

![](images/6.png)
*Figure 6*

5) After observing the values of dataset, we find that the unit for the dataset is "Thousand Dollars", so we should adjust the value. Enter "1000" in any empty cell, and copy it. Select the value part , and then right click to choose "Paste Special". Under the function of Operation, the "Multiply" choice was selected, and then we clicked "OK". Do the same actions in both sheets, and clear the cell of "1000" after completing the above actions.

![](images/7.png)
*Figure 7*

6) All the "Thousand Dollars" were replaced by empty by the function of Replace.

![](images/8.png)
*Figure 8*

7) At last, save the file, "outputFile".

## 4.2 Import and Pivot Data
1) Import the file of "outputFile" into Tableau. And drag "Import" into the pane.

![](images/9.png)
*Figure 9*

2) Select all the columns except the first column, and then right click to choose "Pivot".

![](images/10.png)
*Figure 10*

3) Rename the pivoted columns to "Period" and "Imports" respectively, and change the data type of "Period" column to *Date*.

![](images/11.png)
*Figure 11*

5) Do the similar actions in the sheet of "Export", but rename the pivoted columns to "Period (Export)" and "Exports" respectively. Combine the sheet of "Import" and "Export" by the Region and Period value as *figure 12*.

## 4.4 Final Visualisation

The snapshot of dashboard is shown in the following and then rename the dashboard to “Merchandise Trade”.

![](images/30.png)
*Figure 31*

# 5.	Main Observations
**1) The change of trade roles within the given period**:
Based on the change track of bubbles shown in the visualisation, we can know that the trade roles of most trading partners did not change during the study period, which means that most trading partners kept the roles of net exporters or net importers in this 10 years. However, there are still some changes of trade roles for some trading partners. For example, United State changed from net importers to net exporters from 2019 to 2020 while Malaysia changed from net exporters to net importers from 2018 to 2019.

![](images/33.png)
*Figure 32*

![](images/34.png)
*Figure 33*

**2) Imbalance merchandise trade value among trading partners**:
The position and size of bubbles show that most of the trading partners show relatively small trade values, and they are clustered in the lower left corner of the picture. The top 10 trading partners do far more trade than most other countries, both in terms of exports and imports. These large trading partners tend to be more developed or more populous economies.

![](images/35.png)
*Figure 34*

**3) Hong Kong and Taiwan are special trading partners for Singapore**:
During the given 10 years, the positions of most trading partners, especially the large trading partners, were closed to the diagonal reference line, which means that the difference between exports and imports is not so large for most trading partners. However, the positions of Hong Kong and Taiwan are far from the diagonal reference line. This means that Hong Kong is a net exporters with relative larger trade surplus value while Taiwan is a net importers with relative relative larger trade deficit value.
